            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest
            diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the
            aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
            William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a
            comet or a star.

            It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a
            new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann
            Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery
            Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific
            community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek
            god of the sky, as suggested by Bode
