            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest
            diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the
            aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
            William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a
            comet or a star.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a
            new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann
            Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery
            Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific
            community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek
            god of the sky, as suggested by Bode

              <span id="climate-bigword">Atmosphere</span><br />Uranus'
              atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of
              methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus
              its signature blue color. Uranus' planetary atmosphere, with a
              minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even
              colder than Neptune in some places. Wind speeds can reach up to
              560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are
              retrograde at the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the
              planet’s rotation. But closer to the poles, winds shift to a
              prograde direction, flowing with Uranus' rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span id="climate-bigword">Surface</span><br />As an ice giant,
              Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling
              fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus,
              it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed
              either. The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a
              metal spacecraft.

              <span id="climate-bigword">Potential for life</span><br />Uranus'
              environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The
              temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this
              planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to
              adapt to.

            <span>Jokes</span><br />
            Uranus is the "butt" of more than a few jokes and witty (and not so
            witty) puns, but it's also a frequent destination in various
            fictional stories, such as the video game Mass Effect and TV shows
            like "Doctor Who."
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Greek Good</span><br />
            All of the other planets in the solar system are named after Roman
            Gods except Uranus. Instead Uranus is named after a Greek God. The
            Roman equivalent of Uranus is Caelus.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Old</span><br />
            Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5
            billion years ago. Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved
            to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago. Neptune also
            did this.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span>Lifeless</span><br />
            Uranus cannot support life as we know it.

              <span>Many Moons</span><br />
              Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters
              from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Rotation</span><br />
              Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. But Uranus is unique in
              that it rotates on its side.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Naked Eye</span><br />
              Despite the fact that Uranus is located far from the Sun and had
              eluded astronomers for many centuries, it is still possible to see
              it with the naked eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>The Other Ring World</span><br />
              Uranus has 13 known rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and
              the outer rings are brightly colored.
